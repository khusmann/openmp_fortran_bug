I don't understand it enough to know if this is a deep problem, but I have something you should be able to reproduce.

There are three conditions that together create the memory problems:

1) Compiling the fortran routines with `-fopenmp` in FFLAGS
2) The fortran routine allocates a very large var onto the stack and
3) Calls another fortran routine and passes that very large var to it.

If you change any one of these three things, the read errors go away.
